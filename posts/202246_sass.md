When we create responsive media query in css code, it usually takes long time to implement. However, if you use sass to implement it, it's going to be easier.

```scss
$breakpoints: (
    xs: "screen and (max-width: 600px)",
    s: "screen and (min-width: 600px)",
    m: "screen and (min-width: 768px)",
    l: "screen and (min-width: 992px)",
    xl: "screen and (min-width: 1200px)",
);

@mixin media($breakpoint) {
    @media #{map-get($breakpoints, $breakpoint)}{
        @content;
    }
}
```
