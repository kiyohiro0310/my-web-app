getStaticProps() is the method to pre-render data before web pages show up. Usually, when it's necessary to show the pages quickly, this method is quite useful.

```tsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
    const data = fetchDataFunction();

    return {
        props: {
            data: data
        }
    }
}

```
